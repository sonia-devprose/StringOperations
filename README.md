 **String Operations in C#**

This project demonstrates various string manipulation techniques in C# using basic operations like splitting, reversing, and formatting strings. The primary focus is on handling common string operations that involve splitting a sentence, reversing words, formatting phone numbers, and working with arrays.

#### Features:
1. **Sentence Reversal:**
   - Input: A sentence.
   - Operation: The sentence is split into individual words (separated by spaces), reversed, and then joined to form a new sentence.
   - Example: `"Hello World"` → `"World Hello"`

2. **Phone Number Formatting:**
   - Input: A phone number in the format `XXX-XXX-XXXX`.
   - Operation: Split the phone number using the hyphen (`-`) and reformat it to `(XXX) XXX-XXXX`.
   - Example: `"123-456-7890"` → `"(123) 456-7890"`

3. **Team Members List:**
   - Input: A list of family members or team members, separated by commas.
   - Operation: The names are split, joined using an ampersand (`&`), and formatted to display the names in a readable format.
   - Example: `"Alice, Bob, Charlie, David"` → `"Alice & Bob & Charlie & David"`

#### Technologies Used:
- C#
- Console Application

This project serves as a basic demonstration of string manipulation, useful for anyone learning string handling in C#. The code is clean and well-commented for easy understanding.
